      You begin your journey with Lira the unicorn and Tharos the dragon. You reach a fork in the road.
      • Left: Through the Silver Forest, where illusions trick travelers.
      • Right: Over the Windblown Cliffs, where storms never cease.
      • Straight ahead: Across the Misty Marshes, said to hide secret paths.
